HELLO TEAM

We are currently a simple group of Technologists. We do the mapping – we do the supply chain. We use cutting edge AI in pursuit of our R&D that aims to push the frontiers of how we perceive intelligent-systems. We are simply devising supply chain and logistics solutions at this point in time. But, we are about to use the same framework that goes into building these solutions to change intelligence as we know it – forever.

We will soon build supply chain and logistics systems robotized, governed, and robustized to the point where we will be capable of transporting anything from hash-tokenized-military-assets to sugar. But for now, we do salt.

We start with the operational expenses we have access to from small tier logistics companies with a fleet of 500 trucks that comply with standards set forth by transport authorities (allowing us to architecture governance easily around vendors and other parties involved).

_Our vectorized smart contract calculates your contributions and logs them into the blockchain automating your immediate transfer of funds on your centralized-by-design, decentralized-in-nature metamask wallet on a 4-chain confirmation basis. Contact me at: admin@loremipsumscl.com for issues with your transfers. We are currently in the process of building a UI that allows you to view tokens you have earned. Until then contact admin._

For the first deliverables, we would require a clone of craigslist. The world is a massive downtown of night creatures who’re looking to push the frontiers of what is currently being perceived as intelligence – need I remind you again – the foundation to what we will architecture is currently the foundation to a revolutionary supply-chain management system for transportation of life-essential-salt across one of the most politically conflicted regions in the world ++++ but what it will become of is something that will disrupt the system and break the doors to our perception of intelligence. Now, grab on your commodores, back-door the firmware as we pop nodes around the globe for what will start as a project that open-sources a clone of craigslist...
